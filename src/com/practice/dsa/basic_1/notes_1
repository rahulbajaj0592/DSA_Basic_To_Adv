Scanner class is good for beginners. 

Scanner sc = new scann(System.in)
sc.nextInt
sc.nextFloat
sc.next()

But Buffered reader gives more control and can handle network streams, 
files reading better. I can handle with better exception handling as well 
compare to Scanner class.

InputStreamReader isr = new (System.in);
Buffreader br = new buff(isr);

br.readLine() gives you String
br.read() gives you int that ascii value of input char

can be converted via (char)i;


Java is pass by value not by pass by reference because when you call a 
function in java we pass param but in the function if we updated anything 
to the param the value of the actual param will not change. 
It will be only be change within the function scope not to the actual param.


Complexity : 

Big O measured the worst case complexity that is upper bound.

Theta measures the average case.

Omega measure the best case that is lower bound.

it is not a good practice to update the input.
